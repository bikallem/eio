## v0.7

API changes:

- Unify IO errors as `Eio.Io` (@talex5 #378).  
  This makes it easy to catch and log all IO errors if desired.
  The exception payload gives the type and can be used for matching specific errors.
  It also allows attaching extra information to exceptions, and various functions were updated to do this.

- Add `Time.Mono` for monotonic clocks (@bikallem @talex5 #338).  
  Using the system clock for timeouts, etc can fail if the system time is changed during the wait.

- Allow datagram sockets to be created without a source address (@bikallem @haesbaert #360).  
  The kernel will allocate an address in this case.
  You can also now control the `reuse_addr` and `reuse_port` options.

- Add `File.stat` and improve `Path.load` (@haesbaert @talex5 #339).  
  `Path.load` now uses the file size as the initial buffer size.

- Add `Eio_unix.pipe` (@patricoferris #350).  
  This replaces `Eio_linux.pipe`.

- Avoid short reads from `getrandom(2)` (@haesbaert #344).  
  Guards against buggy user code that might not handle this correctly.

- Rename `Flow.read` to `Flow.single_read` (@talex5 #353).  
  This is a low-level function and it is easy to use it incorrectly by ignoring the possibility of short reads.

Bug fixes:

- Eio_luv: Fix non-tail-recursive continue (@talex5 #378).  
  Affects the `Socket_of_fd` and `Socketpair` effects.

- Eio_linux: UDP sockets were not created close-on-exec (@talex5 #360).

- Eio_linux: work around io_uring non-blocking bug (@haesbaert #327 #355).  
  The proper fix should be in Linux 6.1.

- `Eio_mock.Backend`: preserve backtraces from `main` (@talex5 #349).

- Don't lose backtrace in `Switch.run_internal` (@talex5 #369).

Documentation:

- Use a proper HTTP response in the README example (@talex5 #377).

- Document that read_dir excludes "." and ".." (@talex5 #379).

- Warn about both operations succeeding in `Fiber.first` (@talex5 #358, reported by @iitalics).

- Update README for OCaml 5.0.0~beta2 (@talex5 #375).

Backend-specific changes:

- Eio_luv: add low-level process support (@patricoferris #359).  
  A future release will add Eio_linux support and a cross-platform API for this.

- Expose `Eio_luv.Low_level.Stream.write` (@patricoferris #359).

- Expose `Eio_luv.Low_level.get_loop` (@talex5 #371).  
  This is needed if you want to create resources directly and then use them with Eio_luv.

- `Eio_linux.Low_level.openfile` is gone (@talex5 #378).  
  It was just left-over test code.


## v0.6

Changes:

- Update to OCaml 5.0.0~beta1 (@anmonteiro @talex5 #346).

- Add API for seekable read/writes (@nojb #307).

- Add `Flow.write` (@haesbaert #318).  
  This provides an optimised alternative to `copy` in the case where you are writing from a buffer.

- Add `Net.with_tcp_connect` (@bikallem #302).  
  Convenience function for opening a TCP connection.

- Add `Eio.Time.Timeout` (@talex5 #320).  
  Makes it easier to pass timeouts around.

- Add `Eio_mock.Clock` (@talex5 #328).  
  Control time in tests.

- Add `Buf_read.take_while1` and `skip_while1` (@bikallem #309).  
  These fail if no characters match.

- Make the type parameter for `Promise.t` covariant (@anmonteiro #300).

- Move list functions into a dedicated submodule (@raphael-proust #315).

- Direct implementation of `Flow.source_string` (@c-cube #317).  
  Slightly faster.

Bug fixes:

- `Condition.broadcast` must interlock as well (@haesbaert #324).

- Split the reads into no more than 2^32-1 for luv (@haesbaert @talex5 @EduardoRFS #343).  
  Luv uses a 32 bit int for buffer sizes and wraps if the value passed is too big.

- eio_luv: allow `Net.connect` to be cancelled (@talex5 @nojb #311).

- eio_main: Use dedicated log source (@anmonteiro #326).

- linux_eio: fix kernel version number in log message (@talex5 @nojb #314).

- Account for stack differences in the socketpair test (issue #312) (@haesbaert #313).

Documentation:

- Add Best Practices section to README (@talex5 #299).

- Documentation improvements (@talex5 #295 #337).


## v0.5

New features:

- Add `Eio.Condition` (@TheLortex @talex5 #277).  
  Allows a fiber to wait for some condition to become true.

- Add `Eio.Net.getaddrinfo` and `getnameinfo` (@bikallem @talex5 #278 #288 #291).  
  Convert between host names and addresses.

- Add `Eio.Debug` (@talex5 #276).  
  Currently, this allows overriding the `traceln` function.

- `Buf_write.create`: make switch optional (@talex5 #283).  
  This makes things easier for people porting code from Faraday.

Bug fixes:

- Allow sharing of libuv poll handles (@patricoferris @talex5 #279).  
  Luv doesn't allow two callers to watch the same file handle, so we need to handle that in Eio.

Other changes:

- Upgrade to uring 0.4 (@talex5 #290).

- Mention `Mutex`, `Semaphore` and `Condition` in the README (@talex5 #281).

## v0.4

Note: Eio 0.4 drops compatibility with OCaml 4.12+domains. Use OCaml 5.0.0~alpha1 instead.

API changes:

- `Eio.Dir` has gone. Use `Eio.Path` instead (@talex5 #266 #270).

- `Eio_unix.FD.{take,peek}` were renamed to `take_opt`/`peek_opt` to make way for non-optional versions.

New features:

- Fiber-local storage (@SquidDev #256).  
  Attach key/value bindings to fibers. These are inherited across forks.

- `Eio.Path.{unlink,rmdir,rename}` (@talex5 #264 #265).

- `Eio_main.run` can now return a value (@talex5 #263).  
  This is useful for e.g. cmdliner.

- `Eio_unix.socketpair` (@talex5 #260).

- `Fiber.fork_daemon` (@talex5 #252).  
  Create a helper fiber that does not prevent the switch from exiting.

- Add `Fiber.{iter,map,filter,fiter_map}` (@talex5 #248 #250).  
  These are concurrent versions of the corresponding operations in `List`.

Bug fixes:

- Fix scheduling fairness in luv backend (@talex5 #269).

- Implement remaining shutdown commands for luv (@talex5 #268).

- Fix IPv6 support with uring backend (@haesbaert #261 #262).

- Use `Eio.Net.Connection_reset` exception in more places (@talex5 #257).

- Report use of closed FDs better (@talex5 #255).  
  Using a closed FD could previously cause the whole event loop to exit.

- Some fixes for cancellation (@talex5 #254).

- Ensure `Buf_write` still flushes if an exception is raised (@talex5 #246).

- Do not allow close on `accept_fork` socket (@talex5 #245).

Documentation:

- Document integrations with Unix, Lwt and Async (@talex5 #247).

- Add a Dockerfile for easy testing (@talex5 #224).  

## v0.3

API changes:

- `Net.accept_sub` is deprecated in favour of `accept_fork` (@talex5 #240).  
  `Fiber.fork_on_accept`, which it used internally, has been removed.

- Allow short writes in `Read_source_buffer` (@talex5 #239).  
  The reader is no longer required to consume all the data in one go.
  Also, add `Linux_eio.Low_level.writev_single` to expose this behaviour directly.

- `Eio.Unix_perm` is now `Eio.Dir.Unix_perm`.

New features:

- Add `Eio.Mutex` (@TheLortex @talex5 #223).

- Add `Eio.Buf_write` (@talex5 #235).  
  This is a buffered writer for Eio sinks, based on Faraday.

- Add `Eio_mock` library for testing (@talex5 #228).  
  At the moment it has mock flows and networks.

- Add `Eio_mock.Backend` (@talex5 #237 #238).  
  Allows running tests without needing a dependency on eio_main.
  Also, as it is single-threaded, it can detect deadlocks in test code instead of just hanging.

- Add `Buf_read.{of_buffer, of_string, parse_string{,_exn}, return}` (@talex5 #225).

- Add `<*>` combinator to `Buf_read.Syntax` (@talex5 #227).

- Add `Eio.Dir.read_dir` (@patricoferris @talex5 #207 #218 #219)

Performance:

- Add `Buf_read` benchmark and optimise it a bit (@talex5 #230).

- Inline `Buf_read.consume` to improve performance (@talex5 #232).

Bug fixes / minor changes:

- Allow IO to happen even if a fiber keeps yielding (@TheLortex @talex5 #213).

- Fallback for `traceln` without an effect handler (@talex5 #226).  
  `traceln` now works outside of an event loop too.

- Check for cancellation when creating a non-protected child context (@talex5 #222).

- eio_linux: handle EINTR when calling `getrandom` (@bikallem #212).

- Update to cmdliner.1.1.0 (@talex5 #190).

## v0.2

- Add support for UDP (@patricoferris #171).

- Rename Fibre to Fiber (@talex5 #195). This is to match the compiler's spelling.

- Switch to luv backend if uring can't be used (@talex5 #203).
  Useful on Windows with WSL, and also in Docker containers on older systems.

- Eio_linux: cope with lack of fixed chunks (@talex5 #200).
  - If we run out of fixed memory, just use regular memory instead of waiting (which might deadlock).
  - If we try to allocate a fixed buffer and fail, we now just log a warning and continue without one.

- Add support for FD passing with Eio_linux (@talex5 #199).

- Add `Eio_unix.FD.as_socket` (@talex5 #193).
  Useful for working with existing libraries that provide a `Unix.file_descr`, or for receiving FDs from elsewhere (e.g. socket activation).
  Also, the `Luv.{File,Handle}.of_luv` functions now allow controlling whether to close the wrapped FD.

- Add `Eio_unix.sleep` (@talex5 #188). Based on feedback that some people don't want to treat time as a capability. Possibly also useful for debugging race conditions.

- Tidy up forking API (@talex5 #192). Moves some common code out the the individual backends.

- Improve documentation (@talex5 #197 #194 #186 #185). In particular, explain more low-level details about how cancellation works.

- Add an example `Eio_null` backend (@talex5 #189). This supports creating fibers, promises and cancellation, but provides no IO operations.

- `Effect.eff` is now `Effect.t` in OCaml trunk (@talex5 #201).

## v0.1

- Initial release.
